# Class Description

This set of lessons is designed to help Addiction Science Team Members
develop basic skills in using R and RStudio for data management and
analysis. These lessons focus on using the {tidyverse} collection of
functions and tools to help learners develop data analysis skills that
are adaptable, and develop documents which are shareable.

# Class Outline

-   Lesson 1: Import, Inspect, and Visualize data. This lesson provides
    a brief overview of how to get data into R to work with, defining
    objects, inspecting data frames, and plotting with both base R and
    ggplot2. Includes information about measures of central tendency and
    spread, for those more statistically inclined.

-   Lesson 2: How to Use Select, Filter, and Mutate functions to begin
    wrangling your data. Also includes basic statistical functions to
    enhance your investigation of data & data frames. Learning about
    **Tidy Data**.

-   Lesson 3: Factors, strings, text, and data types. \[In development\]

-   Lesson 4: Exploratory Data Analysis: Combining our tools to
    investigate our data, building a workflow, and using pipes and
    RMarkdown. \[In development\]

-   Lesson 5: Relational data: Splitting, joining, and keys. \[In
    development\]

-   Lesson 6: Confusing everything for dates: No really, what is a date?
    \[In development\]

-   Lesson 7: Missing data \[In development\]

-   Lesson 8: Functions and for loops \[In development\]

# How to Use

You can access this class in a few ways. I recommend using the {usethis}
package to clone the entire file straight from GitHub. You can do so
with the following code in R:

    # If you do not have it already, install usethis package first:
    # install.packages("usethis")

    # Then execute the following line of code:
    usethis::create_from_github("https://github.com/zbudesa/Learn-R-with-Addiction-Science", 
    destdir = <sET DESTINATION FOLDER ON YOUR COMPUTER>)
